    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever considered to start a project without having much funds (some people call it a startup ;))?
There are at least two tools that can help you to make it almost <em>free</em> to start development process.</p>

<p>So, you are a git-lover but you are worried that many private repositories at <em>Github</em> will eat up your funds? It&#8217;s not cost effective!
This might be a case especially when you have a daily job and you work on your top secret project only from time to time.</p>

<p><em>No problem at all</em> - you can give <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> a try. It offers:</p>

<ul>
<li>free private repositories (Git, Mercurial)</li>
<li>bug tracking</li>
<li>wiki pages</li>
</ul>


<p>and many more. There is only one limitation, your team can&#8217;t bigger than 10. But, i bet, it&#8217;s not that big right now :) ?</p>

<p>If you prefer to use <em>board-based methodologies</em> (ie. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>) you should try <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>.
I find it far better than other competitors (I&#8217;ve tested many of them and every single app has something that makes your work really hard) as it offers everything it&#8217;s really needed to manage the team:</p>

<ul>
<li>unlimited projects</li>
<li>users can&#8217;t be grouped in the teams / organizations</li>
<li>user privileges</li>
<li>fully-customizable process (columns, limits per column etc)</li>
<li>comments</li>
<li>notifications</li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230; .</p>

<p>Not to mention it&#8217;s totally free! Their team promised that all of the current features will <em>remain free forever</em>. More future features should be available as paid plugins.</p>

<p><em>Can you recommend other tools for &#8216;startupers&#8217;?</em></p>
